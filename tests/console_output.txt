ELECTRIC BOOGALOO - AI Bomberman

RULES:
• Grid: 13x11, chess notation (A-M cols, 1-11 rows), 11x11 vision
• Walk through: empty (·), bombs (💣), players | BLOCKED by: soft (🟫), hard (⬛)
• ONE bomb at a time (💣0=can place, 💣1=already placed)
• Bombs: Explode after 4 ROUNDS in + pattern (cardinal only, NOT diagonal)
• Range: 1 base, +1 per Flash Radius (⚡) loot pickup
• Scoring: +10 per 🟫 destroyed, +100 per kill
• 1 ROUND = all 4 players move once

CRITICAL - BOMB MECHANICS:
1. Bombs drop at YOUR CURRENT POSITION, then you move (or stay)
2. "Breakable: 1 (up)" means soft block is UP from you - bomb will hit it from HERE
3. After dropping bomb, move to EMPTY space (or stay if safe!)
4. Example: At A2 with "Breakable: 1 (up)", block is at A3
   - ✅ CORRECT: dropBomb:true + direction:"down" (escape to A1)
   - ✅ CORRECT: dropBomb:true + direction:"stay" (if current position safe for 4 rounds)
   - ❌ WRONG: dropBomb:true + direction:"up" (BLOCKED by soft block at A3!)

SURVIVAL:
• DIAGONAL = SAFE from bombs (only cardinal directions lethal)
• If bomb at C5: C4/C6/B5/D5 = DEATH, D6/B4/D4/B6 = SAFE
• Higher range = escape further! Range 2 = 2 tiles, Range 3 = 3 tiles

WINNING STRATEGY:
1. **DESTROY BLOCKS** - Main goal is clearing soft blocks for points (+10 each)
2. **"Breakable: N (direction)"** - When you see this, DROP BOMB and escape
3. Check DANGER - if current position lethal, pick SAFE move
4. Check LOOT (⚡) - Flash Radius increases bomb range
5. Check VALID MOVES - only these directions work

BOMB PLACEMENT (DO THIS OFTEN):
✅ Drop when: "Breakable: 1+" shows adjacent soft blocks + 💣0
✅ Escape route: dropBomb:true + direction to EMPTY space (or stay if safe)
✅ Example: "Breakable: 1 (right)" → dropBomb:true + direction:"left"
❌ WRONG: Trying to move INTO the soft block direction
❌ WRONG: Already have bomb (💣1)
❌ WRONG: Can't escape in time (need 2+ rounds)

RESPONSE (JSON):

  "direction": "up|down|left|right|stay",

SURVIVAL:
• DIAGONAL = SAFE from bombs (only cardinal directions lethal)
• If bomb at C5: C4/C6/B5/D5 = DEATH, D6/B4/D4/B6 = SAFE
• Higher range = escape further! Range 2 = 2 tiles, Range 3 = 3 tiles

WINNING STRATEGY:
1. **DESTROY BLOCKS** - Main goal is clearing soft blocks for points (+10 each)
2. **"Breakable: N (direction)"** - When you see this, DROP BOMB and escape
3. Check DANGER - if current position lethal, pick SAFE move
4. Check LOOT (⚡) - Flash Radius increases bomb range
5. Check VALID MOVES - only these directions work

BOMB PLACEMENT (DO THIS OFTEN):
✅ Drop when: "Breakable: 1+" shows adjacent soft blocks + 💣0
✅ Escape route: dropBomb:true + direction to EMPTY space (or stay if safe)
✅ Example: "Breakable: 1 (right)" → dropBomb:true + direction:"left"
❌ WRONG: Trying to move INTO the soft block direction
❌ WRONG: Already have bomb (💣1)
❌ WRONG: Can't escape in time (need 2+ rounds)

ELECTRIC BOOGALOO - AI Bomberman

RULES:
• Grid: 13x11, chess notation (A-M cols, 1-11 rows), 11x11 vision
• Walk through: empty (·), bombs (💣), players | BLOCKED by: soft (🟫), hard (⬛)
• ONE bomb at a time (💣0=can place, 💣1=already placed)
• Bombs: Explode after 4 ROUNDS in + pattern (cardinal only, NOT diagonal)
• Range: 1 base, +1 per Flash Radius (⚡) loot pickup
• Scoring: +10 per 🟫 destroyed, +100 per kill
• 1 ROUND = all 4 players move once

CRITICAL - BOMB MECHANICS:
1. Bombs drop at YOUR CURRENT POSITION, then you move (or stay)
2. "Breakable: 1 (up)" means soft block is UP from you - bomb will hit it from HERE
3. After dropping bomb, move to EMPTY space (or stay if safe!)
4. Example: At A2 with "Breakable: 1 (up)", block is at A3
   - ✅ CORRECT: dropBomb:true + direction:"down" (escape to A1)
   - ✅ CORRECT: dropBomb:true + direction:"stay" (if current position safe for 4 rounds)

ELECTRIC BOOGALOO - AI Bomberman

RULES:
• Grid: 13x11, chess notation (A-M cols, 1-11 rows), 11x11 vision
• Walk through: empty (·), bombs (💣), players | BLOCKED by: soft (🟫), hard (⬛)
• ONE bomb at a time (💣0=can place, 💣1=already placed)
• Bombs: Explode after 4 ROUNDS in + pattern (cardinal only, NOT diagonal)
• Range: 1 base, +1 per Flash Radius (⚡) loot pickup
• Scoring: +10 per 🟫 destroyed, +100 per kill
• 1 ROUND = all 4 players move once

CRITICAL - BOMB MECHANICS:
1. Bombs drop at YOUR CURRENT POSITION, then you move (or stay)
2. "Breakable: 1 (up)" means soft block is UP from you - bomb will hit it from HERE
3. After dropping bomb, move to EMPTY space (or stay if safe!)
4. Example: At A2 with "Breakable: 1 (up)", block is at A3
   - ✅ CORRECT: dropBomb:true + direction:"down" (escape to A1)
   - ✅ CORRECT: dropBomb:true + direction:"stay" (if current position safe for 4 rounds)
   - ❌ WRONG: dropBomb:true + direction:"up" (BLOCKED by soft block at A3!)

SURVIVAL:
• DIAGONAL = SAFE from bombs (only cardinal directions lethal)
• If bomb at C5: C4/C6/B5/D5 = DEATH, D6/B4/D4/B6 = SAFE
• Higher range = escape further! Range 2 = 2 tiles, Range 3 = 3 tiles

WINNING STRATEGY:
1. **DESTROY BLOCKS** - Main goal is clearing soft blocks for points (+10 each)
2. **"Breakable: N (direction)"** - When you see this, DROP BOMB and escape
3. Check DANGER - if current position lethal, pick SAFE move
4. Check LOOT (⚡) - Flash Radius increases bomb range
5. Check VALID MOVES - only these directions work

BOMB PLACEMENT (DO THIS OFTEN):
✅ Drop when: "Breakable: 1+" shows adjacent soft blocks + 💣0
✅ Escape route: dropBomb:true + direction to EMPTY space (or stay if safe)
✅ Example: "Breakable: 1 (right)" → dropBomb:true + direction:"left"
❌ WRONG: Trying to move INTO the soft block direction
❌ WRONG: Already have bomb (💣1)
❌ WRONG: Can't escape in time (need 2+ rounds)
